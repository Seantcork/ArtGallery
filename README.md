How to use:
Mouse 1 is the program that computes the hull as you click yous mouse around the shape.
Contorls for Mouse 1:
- to clear the polygon press 'r' and then draw your points
-when you are finished drawing your points press 'e'
-then click your mouse to move around the guard.
-when you are finished press 'q' to escape the window.


Mouse2 Controls:
the same control in mouse 1 but with the followin additions.
To move the guard the controls are the following:
'w': Move upwards
'a': move left
'd': move right
's': move down



Current Bugs: There are obviously some rounding points errors where the guard can possibly see through walls and stuff like that but otherwise it looks pretty good and computes the hules pretty well.
